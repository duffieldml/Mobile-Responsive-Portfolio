                                    <p class="about-me">I'm Matt Duffield, a 30 year old living in Grand Rapids, MI. I
                                        was born January 21st,
                                        1991. I
                                        grew in Caledonia, Michigan. I attended Grand Valley State University for 2
                                        years once I
                                        graduated high school in 2009. I was going after a photography degree, but I
                                        dropped out
                                        before
                                        I could complete my degree.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After dropping out of Grand Valley, I started working at Paragon Die &
                                        Engineering. I
                                        met my
                                        wife in 2016. After a couple months of dating, she finished her college degree
                                        for
                                        elementary teaching. She started looking for jobs all over the states to utilize
                                        her new
                                        degree.
                                        Miranda, my wife, was able to find a job in Phoenix, Arizona. I made the
                                        decision to
                                        leave
                                        Michigan behind and follow her.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        At that point, I had been a Paragon Die & Engineering employee for 5 years. I
                                        spoke with
                                        the CEO
                                        of the company and put in my 2 week notice. The next day, the CEO came out and
                                        asked if
                                        I would
                                        like to continue working for Paragon. They decided to let me program CNC
                                        machines from
                                        home. It
                                        was a great opportunity for me.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I lived in Phoenix with my wife for 2 years before we moved back to Michigan. I
                                        fell in
                                        love
                                        with Arizona during my time there. The amount of outdoor activities available
                                        was
                                        fantastic. I
                                        loved hiking in the mountains around the city. Plus, not having to deal with
                                        snow was a
                                        huge
                                        plus. The worst part was the heat. Don't listen to people that say its a dry
                                        heat and
                                        its not
                                        that bad. Sure, it may be a dry heat, but 115 degrees is still hot.
